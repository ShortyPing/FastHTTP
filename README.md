# FastHTTP
## A fast to deploy HTTP Server for Testing
### How to use?
`./fasthttp http <port> - Deploys a Demo Webserver`

`./fasthttp prod <port> - Deploys a Webserver for Current Directory`

Please not that this should not be used as an production webserver because I have not implemented any security features!
